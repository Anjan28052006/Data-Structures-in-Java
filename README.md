# Comprehensive Guide to Data Structures in Java

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science used to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently. Java provides built-in classes and interfaces to implement these structures, which are essential for solving real-world problems effectively.

## Arrays

Arrays are **fixed-size collections** of elements of the same type stored sequentially in memory.

![array](https://codingcompiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Arrays-in-Java.jpg)

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(numbers[0]); // Output: 1
````

### Advantages

* Fast Access to Elements
* Efficient Memory Usage
* Easy Iteration

---

## Linked List

A Linked List is a **dynamic data structure** where each element (node) contains data and a reference to the next node.

![Linked List](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210409184741/HowtoImplementGenericLinkedListinJava.jpg)

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
list.add("Java");
list.add("Python");
System.out.println(list); // Output: [Java, Python]
```

### Advantages

* Dynamic size
* Efficient insertion/deletion
* Slower random access compared to arrays

---

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle**. The most recently added element is the first to be removed. Common operations include `push` (add), `pop` (remove), and `peek` (view top element).

![stack](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/stack-operations.png)

```java
import java.util.Stack;

Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(20);
System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Output: 20
```

### Advantages

* Simplicity in Function Calls
* Undo Mechanism
* Expression Evaluation

---

## Queue

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In First Out (FIFO)** principle.
This means the element inserted first is the one removed first.

### Key Operations:

* **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
* **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
* **Peek/Front**: View the element at the front without removing it.
* **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.

![Queue](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/simple-queue.png)

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
queue.add("Task1");
queue.add("Task2");
System.out.println(queue.poll()); // Output: Task1
```

### Advantages

* Orderly Processing
* Efficient Data Handling
* Fairness in Resource Allocation

---

## HashMap

A **Hash Map** is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing fast access to values based on their unique keys.

It uses a **hash function** to compute an index into an array of buckets, from which the desired value can be found.

![HashMap](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hashmap-in-java-1.png)

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("Apple", 10);
map.put("Banana", 5);
System.out.println(map.get("Apple")); // Output: 10
```

### Advantages

* Fast lookup, insertion, and deletion (average-case O(1) time)
* Keys must be unique
* Commonly used in dictionaries, caches, and indexing

---

## Trees

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure made up of nodes, where each node has a value and links to child nodes.

It starts with a **root node** and branches out, forming a structure similar to a real tree.

### Key Characteristics:

* Each node has one parent (except the root) and zero or more children.
* Common types include **binary trees**, **binary search trees**, and **AVL trees**.
* Used in file systems, databases, and search algorithms.

![Trees](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240415185343/tree-data-structure-banners-%282%29.webp)

```java
class Node {
    int data;
    Node left, right;
    Node(int item) {
        data = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

class BinaryTree {
    Node root;
    BinaryTree() { root = null; }
}
```

### Advantages

* Efficient Searching and Sorting
* Hierarchical Representation
* Optimized Routing and Decision Making

---

## Graphs

A **graph** is a data structure that consists of a set of **nodes** (also called **vertices**) and a set of **edges** that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are used to represent relationships or connections between objects.

![Graph](https://learnloner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Dynamic-Programming-1.png)

```java
import java.util.*;

class Graph {
    private int V;
    private LinkedList<Integer> adj[];

    Graph(int v) {
        V = v;
        adj = new LinkedList[v];
        for(int i=0; i<v; ++i)
            adj[i] = new LinkedList();
    }

    void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adj[v].add(w);
    }
}
```

### Advantages

* Models Complex Relationships
* Flexible Structure
* Handles Cycles and Loops

## Conclusion

Understanding fundamental data structures is essential for efficient problem-solving in computer science.

* **Arrays** provide fast access and are ideal for fixed-size collections.
* **Linked Lists** offer dynamic memory usage and flexible insertion/deletion.
* **Stacks** follow LIFO order and are useful in parsing and backtracking.
* **Queues** follow FIFO order and are great for scheduling and buffering.
* **Hashmaps** allow fast key-value access and are widely used in caching and indexing.
* **Trees** organize data hierarchically and support efficient searching.
* **Graphs** model complex relationships and support powerful algorithms.

Mastering these structures builds a strong foundation for algorithms, system design, and real-world applications.
